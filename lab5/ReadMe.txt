Task 1:
Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from the NCBI, between 1000 and 3000 nucleotides (letters).
a) Take 2000 random samples from this sequence, of about 100-150 bases.
b) Store these samples in an array.
c) Rebuild the original DNA sequence using these random samples.
d) Make a text file answer.txt in which you explain what will be the main issue with the algorithm approach.

Task 2:
