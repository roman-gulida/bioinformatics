The main problem is gaps in coverage. When we take random samples, there is no
guarantee that every position in the original sequence will appear in at least
one sample. Some parts may never be sampled at all, so we canâ€™t reconstruct
those regions.
Even with 2000 samples, random picking can still leave gaps, especially near the
ends or just by chance in some areas. The algorithm can only rebuild the parts
that were actually covered by the samples.
