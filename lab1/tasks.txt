1. Design an application, which is able to find the alphabet of a sequence S, S = "ATTTCGCCGATA"
The alphabet of a sequence constitutes the set of unique symbols, that make up sequence S.

2. Design application, which finds the relative frequences for the symbols found in the alphabet of sequence S. 

3. Use the AI to design an application with a GUI that displays a button and allows a user to choose a FASTA file.
A FASTA file is a specific format for bioinformatics in which specific biological sequences are stored. 
The first line in a file is the information about the sequence line. 
Starting from the second line and till the end of the file is the biological sequence, which is split in 80 char lines. 
Use a FASTA file that is bigger than 100 MB. The output should have all percentages of a sequences.
