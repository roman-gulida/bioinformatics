Task 1:
1. Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology), between 1000 and 3000 nucleotides (letters).

2. Implement a software application that detects repetitions (between 6b and 10b) in this DNA sequence.

Task 2:
Download 10 influenza genomes, for each genome plot on a chart the most frequent repetitions.
