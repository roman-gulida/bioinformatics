Task 1: 
Implement an application that converts the coding region of a gene into an amino acid sequence. Use the genetic code from moodle.

Task 2:
Download from NCBI the FASTA files containing the COVID-19 genome and the influenza genome.  Use the AI to compare the codon freq between
the two. 
a) Make a chart that shows the top 10 most frequent codons for COVID-19.
b) Make a chart that shows the top 10 most frequent codons for influenza.
c) Compare the two results and show the most frequent codons between the two genomes.
d) Show in the ouput of the console top 3 amino-acids for each genome.
