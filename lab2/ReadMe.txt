Task 2_2:
Find in sequence S only Dinucleotides and Trinucleotides that exists, without the use of the brute force engine. 
In order to achieve the results one must check these combinations starting from the beginning of the sequence.
example: S = "ABAA"

Task 2_3:
Design an app using AI, which contains GUI which allows a user to select a FASTA file. 
The content of the file should be analized by using a sliding window of 30 positions. 
The content of each sliding window should be used in order to extract the percentages 
of relative frequencies of the symbols found in the alphabet of the sequence.
Thus your input should be the DNA sequence from the FASTA file and the output should be the values of
relative frequencies of each symbols from the alphabet of the sequence translated in lines on a chart.
Thus your chart in the case of DNA should have 4 lines which reflect the valuees found over the sequence.
