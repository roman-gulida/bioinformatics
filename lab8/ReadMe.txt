Task 1:
1. Make an artificial DNA sequence of 200-400b in length, in which to simulate 3-4 transposable elements.
2. Implement a software application to detect the positions of these transposable elements (start, end) within the created DNA sequence.
Note: Intersect two or three transposons to see how the algorithm behaves in such situations.

Task 2:
Download from NCBI 3 bacterial genomes, use these genomes as an input for your app. 
Also modify your app in order to be able to handle the amount of infromation from these genomes.
Your app must detect transposable elements and the results from the output must show  their position and 
length. In this case, the inverted repeats are unknown, unlike the previous assignment, in which they were known.   

Note: The following cases must be taken into consideration:
1. Transposons involving
2. Transposons overlapping

Note: The minimum size of the inverted repeats must be of 4 basis and the maximum size must be of 6b.
