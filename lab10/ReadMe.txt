Task 1:
Implement a software application that makes DNA patterns from DNA sequences of gene promoters.
 Compute the C+G% and the Kappa Index of Coincidence values from each sliding window.
To ensure that the algorithm implementation works correctly, use the following steps:
1. Use the sequence: S=“CGGACTGATCTATCTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACGTAGCATCTATCGATCTATCTAGCGATCTATCTACTACG”.
2. Use a sliding window of length 30b.
3. Build a function to process the CpG content. The value that the function must return is: CG = 29.27
4. Build a function to process the Index of Coincidence. The value that the function must return is: IC = 27.53 
5. Plot the pattern on a chart.
6. Calculate the center of weight of the pattern.
7. Take the center of each pattern and plot it on a second chart.
8. Take the DNA sequence of a promoter and generate a pattern. Open PromKappa and see if your pattern is the same.

Note: On the GitHub account you will find a version of PromKappa made in JS

Task 2:
Download 10 influenza genomes and 10 covid19 genomes, use the FASTA files to plot their objective digital states.
On a second type of chart plot the center of weight for each ODS. Label each of the 20 centers 
of weight (plotted as a small circle) with the name and variant of the virus.
